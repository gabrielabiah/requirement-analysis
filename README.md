# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

Welcome to the **Requirement Analysis Project** repository.

## üìå About This Repository

This repository is created as part of a hands-on learning project focused on mastering **Requirement Analysis** within the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**. The purpose of this project is to document and analyze the foundational requirements needed to design and develop a **Booking Management System**, using real-world standards and practices.

Throughout this repository, you will find detailed documentation covering:

- Functional and non-functional requirements
- Use case diagrams and system actor interactions
- Visual representations using Draw.io
- Acceptance criteria aligned with business goals
- Structured markdown documentation for clarity and collaboration

The goal is to simulate a real-world requirement analysis phase, enabling the development of scalable and user-centered systems by laying the proper groundwork.

## üìñ What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a crucial phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) that involves gathering, analyzing, validating, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a proposed software system. It acts as the foundation for designing, developing, and deploying a successful application.

During this phase, developers, analysts, and stakeholders collaborate to identify **what the system should do (functional requirements)** and **how well it should perform (non-functional requirements)**. The process ensures a shared understanding of the system goals, features, constraints, and user expectations before any code is written.

### üîç Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- **Clarifies Project Scope**  
  It defines the boundaries and expectations of the project, reducing ambiguity and misunderstandings.

- **Improves Communication**  
  It serves as a communication bridge between technical teams and stakeholders, ensuring all parties are aligned.

- **Reduces Cost and Rework**  
  Identifying and addressing requirements early minimizes errors, reducing the need for costly changes later in development.

- **Guides Design and Development**  
  It provides a clear roadmap for developers, making the design and implementation process more efficient and structured.

- **Supports Testing and Validation**  
  Well-defined requirements help testers build relevant test cases to validate that the software meets the intended purpose.

### üìã Activities Involved in Requirement Analysis

- Requirement Gathering through interviews, surveys, and observation
- Identifying functional and non-functional requirements
- Defining use cases and user stories
- Creating visual models such as use case diagrams and data flow diagrams
- Validating and verifying requirements with stakeholders

In summary, Requirement Analysis ensures that software development begins with a deep understanding of user needs and business goals, setting the stage for delivering valuable, usable, and reliable solutions.

## ‚≠ê Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is a foundational step in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) that significantly influences the success of any software project. Here are three key reasons why it is critical:

### 1. Prevents Misunderstandings and Scope Creep  
By clearly defining what the software should and should not do, requirement analysis ensures all stakeholders have a shared understanding. This reduces the chances of miscommunication and helps prevent scope creep, which can lead to delays and budget overruns.

### 2. Improves Design and Development Efficiency  
Well-documented requirements act as a blueprint for the design and development phases. Developers can write better-structured code and architects can create more effective system designs when they have a clear set of expectations to follow.

### 3. Enables Better Testing and Validation  
Requirements provide a solid basis for creating test cases. When requirements are specific and measurable, it becomes easier to verify if the final product meets the intended goals, which helps improve quality and reliability.

In summary, requirement analysis helps align the development process with business objectives, minimizes risks, and increases the likelihood of delivering a successful product.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves several structured activities that help ensure the success of a software project. Below are the five key activities typically performed during this phase:

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  This involves collecting information from stakeholders such as clients, users, and domain experts to understand what they expect from the system. Techniques include interviews, questionnaires, observation, and reviewing existing documentation.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Elicitation goes beyond just gathering data‚Äîit focuses on uncovering the real needs of users, which may not be explicitly stated. This step uses strategies like brainstorming, workshops, role-playing, and use case scenarios to identify both functional and non-functional needs.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  All collected and elicited requirements are clearly documented in a structured format. This can include Software Requirement Specifications (SRS), user stories, use case diagrams, and flowcharts. The goal is to ensure all stakeholders can review and understand the requirements.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  At this stage, the requirements are examined for clarity, completeness, feasibility, and consistency. Modeling tools such as data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams, and use case diagrams are often used to visualize system behavior and interactions.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  The final step is to confirm that the documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs. Validation involves reviews, walkthroughs, and approval sessions with clients or end users to ensure everything is correct before moving on to design and development.

These activities form the backbone of a successful software project by ensuring that the development team builds the right system for the right purpose.
