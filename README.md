# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

Welcome to the **Requirement Analysis Project** repository.

## ðŸ“Œ About This Repository

This repository is created as part of a hands-on learning project focused on mastering **Requirement Analysis** within the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**. The purpose of this project is to document and analyze the foundational requirements needed to design and develop a **Booking Management System**, using real-world standards and practices.

Throughout this repository, you will find detailed documentation covering:

- Functional and non-functional requirements
- Use case diagrams and system actor interactions
- Visual representations using Draw.io
- Acceptance criteria aligned with business goals
- Structured markdown documentation for clarity and collaboration

The goal is to simulate a real-world requirement analysis phase, enabling the development of scalable and user-centered systems by laying the proper groundwork.

Stay tuned as this repository evolves into a comprehensive blueprint for effective requirement analysis in modern software development.
