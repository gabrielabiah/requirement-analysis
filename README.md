# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

Welcome to the **Requirement Analysis Project** repository.

## üìå About This Repository

This repository is created as part of a hands-on learning project focused on mastering **Requirement Analysis** within the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**. The purpose of this project is to document and analyze the foundational requirements needed to design and develop a **Booking Management System**, using real-world standards and practices.

Throughout this repository, you will find detailed documentation covering:

- Functional and non-functional requirements
- Use case diagrams and system actor interactions
- Visual representations using Draw.io
- Acceptance criteria aligned with business goals
- Structured markdown documentation for clarity and collaboration

The goal is to simulate a real-world requirement analysis phase, enabling the development of scalable and user-centered systems by laying the proper groundwork.

## üìñ What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a crucial phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) that involves gathering, analyzing, validating, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a proposed software system. It acts as the foundation for designing, developing, and deploying a successful application.

During this phase, developers, analysts, and stakeholders collaborate to identify **what the system should do (functional requirements)** and **how well it should perform (non-functional requirements)**. The process ensures a shared understanding of the system goals, features, constraints, and user expectations before any code is written.

### üîç Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- **Clarifies Project Scope**  
  It defines the boundaries and expectations of the project, reducing ambiguity and misunderstandings.

- **Improves Communication**  
  It serves as a communication bridge between technical teams and stakeholders, ensuring all parties are aligned.

- **Reduces Cost and Rework**  
  Identifying and addressing requirements early minimizes errors, reducing the need for costly changes later in development.

- **Guides Design and Development**  
  It provides a clear roadmap for developers, making the design and implementation process more efficient and structured.

- **Supports Testing and Validation**  
  Well-defined requirements help testers build relevant test cases to validate that the software meets the intended purpose.

### üìã Activities Involved in Requirement Analysis

- Requirement Gathering through interviews, surveys, and observation
- Identifying functional and non-functional requirements
- Defining use cases and user stories
- Creating visual models such as use case diagrams and data flow diagrams
- Validating and verifying requirements with stakeholders

In summary, Requirement Analysis ensures that software development begins with a deep understanding of user needs and business goals, setting the stage for delivering valuable, usable, and reliable solutions.
